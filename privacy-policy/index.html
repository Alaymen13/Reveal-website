            Personal Information Collected Via Cookies and Similar Technologies
          </h4>
          <h5 class="wp-block-heading">First and Third-Party Cookies</h5>
          <p>
            A “cookie” is a small file created by a web server that can be
            stored on your device (if you allow) for use either during a
            particular browsing session (a “session” cookie) or a future
            browsing session (a “persistent” cookie). “Session” cookies are
            temporarily stored on your hard drive and only last until they
            expire at the end of your browsing session. “Permanent” cookies
            remain stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted by
            you. Local stored objects (or “flash” cookies) are used to collect
            and store information about your preferences and navigation to,
            from, and on a website. First-party cookies are set by the Site, and
            they can only be read by the Site. Third Party Cookies are set by a
            party other than us. We use first-party and third-party session,
            persistent, and/or flash cookies and the information collected by
            them as set forth below.
          </p>
          <h5 class="wp-block-heading">Similar Technologies</h5>
          <p>
            In addition to cookies, there are other automatic data collection
            technologies, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel
            tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log
            files, server logs, etc.) that can be used to collect data as users
            navigate through and interact with the Site:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Web beacons:</strong> These are tiny graphics (sometimes
            called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) with unique identifiers that
            are used to understand browsing activity. In contrast to cookies,
            which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are
            rendered invisible on web pages when you open a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Social Widgets:</strong> These are buttons or icons provided
            by third-party social media providers that allow you to interact
            with social media services when you view a webpage or mobile app
            screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be
            received by the third party that provided the widget and are
            controlled by third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>UTM Codes:</strong> These are strings that can appear in a
            URL (the “Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or
            https address entered to go to a web page) when you move from one
            web page or website to another, where the string can represent
            information about browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or
            publisher sent the user to the receiving website.

            We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we
            collect when (1) we have a legal obligation to do so, (2) we no
            longer have a purpose for retaining the information, and (3) if you

            HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

            We have put security measures in place to protect the personal
            information that you share with us from being accidentally lost,
            used, altered, or disclosed or accessed in an unauthorized manner.
            From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider

            While our security measures seek to protect your personal

            own risk. We cannot promise that your personal information will
            remain absolutely secure in all circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The safety and security of your personal information also depends on
            you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the
            Site, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential. Do

            Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the right
            to direct us to stop selling your personal information to third
            parties and to refrain from doing so in the future. For purposes of
            the CCPA, we do not sell personal information as defined under
            applicable law.

            <strong>CCPA Requests to Know and Requests to Delete</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The CCPA gives consumers the right to request that we (1) disclose
            what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, and
            (2) delete certain personal information that we have collected or
            maintain. You may submit these requests to us as described below,
            and we honor these rights where they apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, by way of example, these rights do not apply where we
            collect or sell a consumer’s personal information if: (1) we
            collected that information while the consumer was outside of
            California, (2) no part of a sale of the consumer’s personal
            information occurred in California, and (3) no personal information
            collected while the consumer was in California is sold. In addition,
            de-identified information is not subject to these rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a request is submitted in a manner that is not one of the
            designated methods for submission, or if the request is deficient in
            some manner unrelated to our verification process, we will either
            (1) treat the request as if it had been submitted in accordance with
            the designated manner, or (2) provide you with specific directions
            on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with the
            request, as applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have the right to request: (1) the specific pieces of personal
            information we have collected about you; (2) the categories of
            personal information we have collected about you; (3) the categories
            of sources from which the personal information is collected; (4) the
            categories of personal information about you that we have sold and
            the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was
            sold; (5) the categories of personal information about you that we
            disclosed for a business purpose and the categories of third parties
            to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business
            purpose; (6) the business or commercial purpose for collecting,
            disclosing, or selling personal information; and (7) the categories
            of third parties with whom we share personal information. Our
            response will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of a
            verifiable request.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Verification Procedures</h4>
          <p>
            To determine whether the individual making the request is the
            consumer about whom we have collected information, we will verify
            your identity by matching the identifying information provided by
            you in the request to the personal information that we already
            maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will be required
            to provide your name, address, telephone number, and last placement
            with one of our Clients. If you only use the Website (and not the
            Developer Platform) we may not be able to verify your identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we cannot verify your identity based on the information already
            maintained, we may request additional information from you. We will
            try to limit the information collected, and we will only use this
            information to verify your identity and for security or
            fraud-prevention purposes. Except as required by law, we will delete
            any new personal information collected for the purposes of
            verification as soon as practical after processing the request.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Password-Protected Account:</strong> If you have a
            password-protected account with us, we may verify your identity
            through our existing authentication practices for the account. We
            will require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or
            deleting your data. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity
            on or from the password-protected account, we will not comply with
            the request until further verification procedures determine that the
            request is authentic and that the consumer making the request is the
            person about whom we have collected information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We require different levels of authentication based upon the nature
            of the personal information requested. A more stringent verification
            process is applied when (1) sensitive or valuable personal
            information is involved, (2) there is a greater risk of harm to the
            consumer, and/or (3) there is a higher likelihood that fraudulent or
            malicious actors would request the information
          </p>
          <h4 class="wp-block-heading">Authorized Agents</h4>
          <p>
            Authorized agents may submit requests via the methods identified in
            this Policy. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to
            know or a request to delete, we may require you to: (1) provide the
            authorized agent with signed permission to do so; (2) verify your
            identity directly with us; and (3) directly confirm with us that you
            provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
            However, we will not require these actions if you have provided the
            authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California
            Probate Code. We may deny a request from an agent that does not
            submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act
            on their behalf.

            <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In some cases, you have a legal
            right to request that we delete your personal information when (1)
            it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was
            collected, (2) consent has been withdrawn in certain instances, (3)
            you have objected to the processing in certain instances, (4) the

            (6) the personal data were collected in relation to the offer of

            When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our
            active servers and databases as well as the Site; but, it may remain
            in our archives when it is not practical or possible to delete it.
            We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply
            with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce any
            agreements.

          <p>
            <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to

            personal data; (2) the processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure
            and request a restriction instead; (3) we no longer need the
            personal data, but you need us to keep it for the establishment,
            exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (4) you have objected to us

            out in the public interest, for our legitimate interests, or for the
            legitimate interests of others. You also have the right to object
            where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes or

            CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), as well as
            other data privacy regulations, restrict the collection, use, or
            disclosure of personal information from and about children on the
            Internet. Our Site and services are not directed to children aged 16
            or younger, nor is information knowingly collected from children
            under the age of 16. No one under the age of 16 may access, browse,
            or use the Site or provide any information to or on the Site. If you
            are under 16, please do not use or provide any information on the
            Site (including, for example, your name, telephone number, email
            address, or username). If we learn that we have collected or
            received personal information from a child under the age of 16
            without a parent’s or legal guardian’s consent, we will take steps
            to stop collecting that information and delete it. If you believe we
            might have any information from or about a child under the age of
            16, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
          </p>
