            A "cookie" is a little file created by a web server that can be saved on your device (if you permit) and used for future browsing sessions (a "persistent" cookie) or just for that particular browsing session (a "session" cookie). "Session" cookies are only kept on your hard disk for the duration of your browsing session, after which they expire. "Permanent" cookies are those that 
          </p>
          <p>
            stay on your hard drive after you've erased them or until they expire. To gather and retain information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and within a website, local stored objects (also known as "flash" cookies) are employed. The Site is the only entity that can read first-party cookies because they are placed by the Site. A party other than us sets third-party cookies. As stated below, we use session, persistent, flash, and/or first-party and third-party cookies, as well as the data they gather.

            In addition to cookies, there are other automatic data collection tools that can be used to gather information as users move around and interact with the Site, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, etc.):

            Web beacons are minute images with unique identifiers that are used to track browsing behavior. They are also known as "clear GIFs" or "web pixels." Web beacons are invisible when you first access a web page, unlike cookies, which are saved on your computer's hard drive.

            Social widgets are buttons or icons that third-party social media service providers offer so that you can access social media platforms when viewing a website or mobile app screen.

            <strong>Cookies and Related Technologies Used to Gather Personal Information First-Party and Third-Party Cookies </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            A "cookie" is a little file created by a web server that can be saved on your device (if you permit) and used for future browsing sessions (a "persistent" cookie) or just for that particular browsing session (a "session" cookie). "Session" cookies are only kept on your hard disk for the duration of your browsing session, after which they expire. "Permanent" cookies are those that stay on your hard drive after you've erased them or until they expire. To gather and retain information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and within a website, local stored objects (also known as "flash" cookies) are employed. The Site is the only entity that can read first-party cookies because they are placed by the Site. A party other than us sets third-party cookies. As stated below, we use session, persistent, flash, and/or first-party and third-party cookies, as well as the data they gather.

            <strong>Comparable Technology </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            In addition to cookies, there are other automatic data collection tools that can be used to gather information as users move around and interact with the Site, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, etc.): 
          </p>
          <p>
            Web beacons are minute images with unique identifiers that are used to track browsing behavior. They are also known as "clear GIFs" or "web pixels." Web beacons are invisible when you first access a web page, unlike cookies, which are saved on your computer's hard drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social widgets are buttons or icons that third-party social media service providers offer so that you can access social media platforms when viewing a website or mobile app screen. These social widgets may gather browser information, which the third party who provides the widget and is under its control may obtain.
